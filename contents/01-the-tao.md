# Chapter 1: The Tao

The Tao that can be described is not the eternal Tao.  
The name that can be spoken of is not the eternal name.  
The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.  
The named is the Mother of all things.  
Thus, the constant void enables one to see the hidden mystery.  
The constant being enables one to see the physical reality.  
Yet, mystery and reality emerge from the same source.  
This source is called darkness.  
Darkness born from darkness.  
The beginning of all understanding.  
And it is the Gate to the essence of all life.
