# Chapter 2: The Oneness 

When people see things as beautiful, ugliness is created.  
When people see things as good, evil is created.  
Being and non-being produces each other.  
Difficult and easy compliments each other.  
Long and short defines each other.  
High and low opposes each other.  
Before and after follows each other.  
Therefore, the saint can act without doing anything, and teach without saying a word.  
Things come her way, she does not stop them.  
Things leave, and she let them go.  
She has without possession, and act without any expectation.  
When her work is done, she takes no credit.  
That is why it will last forever.
